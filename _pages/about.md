Hello there! I am The Real Gabe Guo, an aspiring happy scientist. I am interested in designing mathematically principled machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on efficiency. I am also interested in computational materials science.

Background
=====
I am a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University. My research is supported by the [Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). I am advised by the spectacular [Professor Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).

I graduated from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science in 2024, with a B.S. degree in Computer Science. There, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) at Columbia University under the honorific [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/), the Billinge Group under the supreme [Professor Simon Billinge](https://billingegroup.github.io/), and the ZGroup under the remarakable [Professor Richard Zemel](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/). I additionally learned irreplacable lessons in both research and teaching from the terrific [Professor Tony Dear](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/tony-dear). Prior to that, I was a high school and undergraduate research assistant at the Embedded Sensors and Computing Lab under the wonderful Professor [Wenyao Xu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/).

In my free time, I make rap music (production, writing, vocals, videography).
