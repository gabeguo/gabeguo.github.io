Hello there! I am The Real Gabe Guo, an aspiring happy scientist. My research interests are in computational materials science, biometrics, and robust representation learning.

Background
=====
I will be a Computer Science PhD student at Stanford University, starting September 2024. My research will be supported by the [Department of Energy's Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/). I am currently a postbaccalaureate research assistant in [Hod Lipson's Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) and [Richard Zemel's group](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/) at Columbia University.

I graduated from Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science in May 2024, with a B.S. degree in Computer Science. There, I was an undergraduate research assistant in the [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) at Columbia University, working under the incomparable [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/). During my time there, I also collaborated with the supreme [Professor Simon Billinge](https://billingegroup.github.io/) and the terrific [Professor Tony Dear](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/tony-dear). Prior to that, I was a high school and undergraduate research assistant at the Embedded Sensors and Computing Lab under the wonderful Professor [Wenyao Xu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~wenyaoxu/).

In my free time, I create meme rap and contemporary classical music.
